# Bark-Alert
#### Student Name: *Cian Dunne*   Student ID: *20091471*

A sound sensor is listening to the room - most likely the sitting room. Multiple sensors could be positioned in the house, if necessary but I will focus on one for now. When the volume level reaches a certain decibel limit say 85-90dB, which will indicate the dog has begun to bark, an alert will be sent to the ownerâ€™s phone telling them the dog has begun barking.
The owner will also receive a prompt to trigger a camera in the room to view the dog and what they are barking at - a passing car, a person walking along the street, an unknown individual approaching the house.
A speaker will be attached to the sensor - when the alert is triggered the speaker will emit a frequency that is imperceptible to humans but mildly uncomfortable for dogs.
The frequency will occur in short bursts (2-3 seconds with 20 second intervals) until the sensor determines sound levels have dropped below 70dB again.
Once the sensor has determined the barking has subsided, a note of the date, time, and length of time spent barking will be sent to a Database.
A weekly report will be generated for the barking determining the average amount of time spent barking per day and comparing it to the level of barking from the previous week.
